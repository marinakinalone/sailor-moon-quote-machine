## What I have learned from this project
This project was my first web app created from scratch using React. It's a little bit embarrassing to read, but hey, we've got to start somewhere... Since this project is very simple, I decided to use it as a playground to familiarize myself with new technologies I want to try. From a React class-based components project, I converted the whole project to Next JS.
One cool thing I learned is how to use the classnames utility to add multiple classnames with CSS modules in React!
